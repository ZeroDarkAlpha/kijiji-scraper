I haven't gotten around to posting this ad until now, so if you are a serious graduate or 4th year student looking for a quiet place to stay then this is your lucky day!
I am a live-in landlord with a furnished home that is located 15 minutes walking distance from both the University and Masonville Mall. There is currently one other student staying here who is from South Korea.
No gender preference.
Medium room is $630 inclusive on 12 month lease.
Smaller room is $615 inclusive on 12 month lease.
Let me be clear: NO ALCOHOL, NO PARTIES, NO PETS, NO SMOKING, NO OVERNIGHT GUESTS, AND A TWO GUEST LIMIT DURING THE DAY. As a live-in landlord who shares the kitchen, I am entitled to place these conditions into the lease. I have had a number of students stay here and they are always pleased and, in fact, prefer a quite home instead of the typical student housing out there.
This is a clean home that is ideal for serious students.
A bed, desk, dresser, and kitchen supplies are all here so you won't have to bring anything like that.
There are two rooms available which share the same bathroom. I have my own bathroom, as does the other student staying here.
Utilities are inclusive, as follows: Heat, Hydro, Central Air, Gas, and Internet.
Other info:
Laundry room on main floor.

It will only be the two of us most of the time. I like animals and I have marked pet friendly but it will depend on type of pet, etc. We will respect each other's space.
Your bedroom has a view of the garden. We will share a 4-piece bathroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, back deck/garden. There is an additional powder room on the main floor.
This is a lovely quiet street that backs onto the rail trail taking you for cycling or hikes in the conservation area, to a park with tennis court, to Fortinos or to McMaster (about 20 minutes walk). The city bus is literally a minute walk and will get you to Mac in just a few minutes.
Rent of $1000 includes all utilities, unlimited high speed internet, linens, kitchen utensils, furnishings, etc. You only need to bring your personal things.
I am looking for a great roommate who is respectful and tidy. Email me to check it out.</p></div></div>]","<span class=""address-3617944557"" itemprop=""address"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/PostalAddress"">Tweedsmuir Ave, Hamilton, ON L9H 4H5, Canada</span>","<time datetime=""2019-08-31T16:26:38.000Z"" title=""August 31, 2019 4:26 PM"">4 days ago</time>",Furnished : YesPet Friendly : No,
