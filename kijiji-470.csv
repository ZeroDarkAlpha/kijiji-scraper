Overview
Located at the junction of Davenport Road and Mcmurrick Street, The Yorkville has a striking V-shaped corner façade of geometric glass and steel, bringing a smart and contemporary feel to the area.
The building rises 31-storeys and contains 233 Toronto condos for sale and for rent, with a mix of apartment style units and urban townhouses. With a wide variety of sizes and layouts from studios to two-bedrooms plus den, The Yorkville will offer something for every lifestyle, showcasing hardwood floors, quartz and natural stone countertops, fully modern bathrooms with marble flooring, and private balconies. The building amenities are designed for the high-end lifestyles of Yorkville residents, focusing on the social side of life. A lifestyle that will be catered to at home and continued out in the Yorkville neighbourhood, with fine dining restaurants, top bars and clubs, boutique shopping, and intriguing art galleries all at your fingertips. The Yorkville is an ideal residence for young professionals looking to live large and seize the city.</p><p>Most Notable Features
On top of Yorkville: With a great location, just north of Yorkville's main scene of boutique shops and gourmet restaurants, residents at The Yorkville will feel as though they live right on top of Toronto’s trendiest neighbourhood. Stroll along Yorkville Avenue from Bay to Yonge Street within minutes, or pop down to Bloor Street via convenient TTC routes. The town is yours!
Club Yorkville: Among the amenities package, residents will have access to Club Yorkville, an exclusive lounge that opens to a piano bar and billiards room, an elegant dining room with a private wine cellar and a full gourmet kitchen and catering facilities. Not to mention there is also a full fitness centre and rooftop terrace.
Urban Townhouses: Rare among downtown Toronto condos, The Yorkville offers a selection of urban townhouse units within the building’s ground floor podium. Sharing much of the same designs and finishes as the tower units, the townhouses are perfect for homeowners who want a bit more space, street-level access, and the preferred vibe of a house over an apartment.</p></div></div>]","<span class=""address-3617944557"" itemprop=""address"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/PostalAddress"">Davenport Rd, Toronto, ON M5R 0B5, Canada</span>","<time datetime=""2019-08-15T01:40:02.000Z"" title=""August 15, 2019 1:40 AM"">21 days ago</time>","Unit TypeCondo : Bedrooms1 + Den : Bathrooms1 : Parking Included0 : Agreement Type1 Year : Move-In DateSeptember 1, 2019 : Pet FriendlyNo : Size (sqft)680 : FurnishedYes : Air ConditioningYes : Smoking PermittedNo : Barrier-free Entrances and RampsYes : Visual AidsNo : Accessible Washrooms in SuiteNo : ",

Room Available for mature student or working professional,$650.00,"[<div class=""descriptionContainer-3544745383""><h3 class=""title-1536205785"">Description</h3><div><p>Available from Sept 15th is one unfurnished room in a furnished home with the landlady and her toddler living upstairs and a couple renting the basement. Basement tenants have their own fridge / freezer and bathroom, but the kitchen space and main floor are shared by all. The house features a large deck/patio and backyard, a beautiful sun room and living room space, a dishwasher, laundry machines, a guest bedroom, and parking for one vehicle.
The home is located in the north end of Guelph near Speedvale and the Hanlon. Rent is $650 per month, utilities included (but the cost of internet will be divided by three). First and last month’s rent will be expected at the start. Preference will be given to applicants who desire to rent for a full year.</p><p>Some things we are looking for in a new roommate:</p><p>Feel comfortable around children, and be respectful of his parents’ rules around him. This also means a commitment to making the space safe. Some nights he is going to spend at his father’s home, but when he is sleeping upstairs, it is important to respect the need for a quieter environment (he sleeps through ambient noises made elsewhere in the house). He is a pleasure to be around, but like all children his age, a little noise and messiness must be tolerated. We keep a clean home but during the day, the main floor can get a little messy with toys and the like.</p><p>Respect our desire to save energy by only running the dishwasher and laundry machines after 7p.m. during the week. Anytime on weekends is fine.</p><p>Contribute to keep shared spaces clean, and be willing to share the workload of basic property maintenance such as taking out garbage, snow shoveling, yard trimming.</p><p>Be respectful in their plans to have guests at the house by notifying the other inhabitants in advance.</p><p>Have an interest in basic responsible environmental practices e.g. recycling, using non-toxic cleaning products, and moderate water usage.</p><p>Feel comfortable around our dog, who is super friendly and mild-mannered.</p><p>An ideal tenant would be a mature student or young professional. LGBTQ+ friendly. We might be open to having your pet here if the fit is right for the child and our dog. Only responsible pet owners (i.e. that walk and pick up after pets) will be considered.</p></div></div>]","<span class=""address-3617944557"" itemprop=""address"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/PostalAddress"">, Guelph N1H 7K1 ON, Canada</span>","<time datetime=""2019-09-04T15:54:18.000Z"" title=""September 4, 2019 3:54 PM"">about 4 hours ago</time>",Furnished : NoPet Friendly : Yes,

Overview
Located at the junction of Davenport Road and Mcmurrick Street, The Yorkville has a striking V-shaped corner façade of geometric glass and steel, bringing a smart and contemporary feel to the area.
The building rises 31-storeys and contains 233 Toronto condos for sale and for rent, with a mix of apartment style units and urban townhouses. With a wide variety of sizes and layouts from studios to two-bedrooms plus den, The Yorkville will offer something for every lifestyle, showcasing hardwood floors, quartz and natural stone countertops, fully modern bathrooms with marble flooring, and private balconies. The building amenities are designed for the high-end lifestyles of Yorkville residents, focusing on the social side of life. A lifestyle that will be catered to at home and continued out in the Yorkville neighbourhood, with fine dining restaurants, top bars and clubs, boutique shopping, and intriguing art galleries all at your fingertips. The Yorkville is an ideal residence for young professionals looking to live large and seize the city.</p><p>Most Notable Features
On top of Yorkville: With a great location, just north of Yorkville's main scene of boutique shops and gourmet restaurants, residents at The Yorkville will feel as though they live right on top of Toronto’s trendiest neighbourhood. Stroll along Yorkville Avenue from Bay to Yonge Street within minutes, or pop down to Bloor Street via convenient TTC routes. The town is yours!
Club Yorkville: Among the amenities package, residents will have access to Club Yorkville, an exclusive lounge that opens to a piano bar and billiards room, an elegant dining room with a private wine cellar and a full gourmet kitchen and catering facilities. Not to mention there is also a full fitness centre and rooftop terrace.
Urban Townhouses: Rare among downtown Toronto condos, The Yorkville offers a selection of urban townhouse units within the building’s ground floor podium. Sharing much of the same designs and finishes as the tower units, the townhouses are perfect for homeowners who want a bit more space, street-level access, and the preferred vibe of a house over an apartment.</p></div></div>]","<span class=""address-3617944557"" itemprop=""address"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/PostalAddress"">Davenport Rd, Toronto, ON M5R 0B5, Canada</span>","<time datetime=""2019-08-15T01:40:02.000Z"" title=""August 15, 2019 1:40 AM"">21 days ago</time>","Unit TypeCondo : Bedrooms1 + Den : Bathrooms1 : Parking Included0 : Agreement Type1 Year : Move-In DateSeptember 1, 2019 : Pet FriendlyNo : Size (sqft)680 : FurnishedYes : Air ConditioningYes : Smoking PermittedNo : Barrier-free Entrances and RampsYes : Visual AidsNo : Accessible Washrooms in SuiteNo : ",

2,200 sf of high (two storey loft height) completely open, unobstructed space with an additional, complimentary 650sf mezzanine for storage.

2,200sf of extremely reasonable rent to the right business opportunity! Lots of power on site. Separate electric meter for the unit.
The other building on the double lot at 248 Front Street North has been recently renovated into two luxury apartments.
There are two boat launch ramps on the property and a boat dock - and a 10 ton crane on tracks.
